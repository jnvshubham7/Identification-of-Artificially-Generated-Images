# Deepfake Detection Model

## Overview
This repository contains code for building and training a deep learning model to detect deepfake images. The model is trained to classify images as either real or fake, with a focus on identifying deepfake content.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training, testing, and validation consists of real and fake images. It is structured with separate directories for each class, and appropriate preprocessing techniques are applied to ensure data quality and model generalization.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on a pretrained ResNet50 neural network, with additional layers added for fine-tuning. Transfer learning is employed to leverage knowledge learned from the ImageNet dataset, enhancing the model's ability to detect features relevant to deepfake detection.

## Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the training set and validated using a separate validation set. Early stopping and model checkpointing techniques are utilized to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Evaluation metrics such as loss, accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are computed to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Sample Prediction
A sample prediction functionality is included, demonstrating how the model can classify a randomly selected image from the test set as either real or fake. This provides a practical illustration of the model's performance in real-world scenarios.

## Usage
To train the model, simply run the provided Python script after setting up the necessary environment and ensuring access to the dataset. The trained model can then be used for inference or further analysis as needed.
